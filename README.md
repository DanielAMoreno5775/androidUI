# Android UI Experiments
------------------------
### Compatible Android Versions
This is a Kotlin-based app for the Android OS 4.4 (API Level 19 KitKat) up to Android 14 (API Level 34 Upside Down Cake).
------------------------
### Brief Description
The app contains 3 fragments which represent the 3 primary pages: Home, Dashboard, and Settings. The Home fragment contains an auto-carousel which will display the 3 images used elsewhere in the app. A gesture can also be used to advance the carousel. The Dashboard fragment has 3 buttons with individual colors and icons. When a button is clicked, the image view on the Dashboard fragment transitions from its current image to the image associated with the clicked button. The transition utilizes the built-in slide_in_left and fade_out animations. The Settings fragment contains a switch button. Click the switch to toggle between light and dark mode color schemes which are defined in the two themes.xml files.

There are 3 distinct images being used in this project. The first image resembles a red circuit board with scrolling binary text and a lock in the center. I created this image using extensive photobashing. The second image is a drawing of a scifi tank. The third image is a drawing of a fantasy city. These last images were drawn by and used with permission from my sister.
